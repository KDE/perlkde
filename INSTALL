PerlQt version 0.01       
===================

For simple install instructions, see the README file.

This module uses cmake for it's build system.  If you don't have it, you can
download the most recent version at
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

First, I recommend building the module in it's own directory.  Type:
    mkdir build
    cd build

cmake provides a nice 'GUI'ish interface to view compile time options.  To view
this, type:
    ccmake ..
    c

Once that finishes, exit with 'q', and type:
    cmake ..

If you just want to use all the default values and paths, you can skip the
ccmake step.

The standard options are:
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = The type of build ('Debug', 'Release', etc)
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = The location for any executables ( e.g. puic4 )
    CUSTOM_PERL_SITE_ARCH_DIR = The location for the perl modules themselves.
    ENABLE_PERLQT = Build PerlQt bindings.  You'll want this.
    ENABLE_SMOKE = Build SmokeQt.  See below.
    QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE = The path to your system's qmake.

Building this module involves 2 main parts.  First it builds the smokeqt
object, then it builds the bindings.  The Smoke object is the generic interface
to the Qt library that the Perl bindings are built on top of.  If you already
have a SmokeQt object built, you can use your system's library by setting
ENABLE_SMOKE=OFF.

cmake looks in your path for a qmake executable.  If it can't find it, it will
complain and fail to configure properly.  If your qmake is not in your path,
you can tell cmake where to find it by either setting it in ccmake, or on the
commandline with:
    cmake .. -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/my/qmake

Once configured, compile and install with:
    make
    make install
