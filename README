PerlQt version 0.01
===================

This module provides bindings to the Qt 4 libraries for Perl.

PREREQUISITES

Perl > 5.  I've tested on Perl 5.8.6 and 5.10.0.
Qt > 4.0.  I've tested on Qt 4.4.3, 4.5.0, and 4.5.1.
cmake

INSTALLATION

I recommend building the bindings in their own directory.  From the top level
directory, type:

    mkdir build
    cd build

To install the bindings, type:

    cmake ..
    make
    make install

For more information, see the INSTALL file.

EXAMPLES

The bindings currently come with a number of example scripts that are direct
ports of the examples that ship with the Qt library.  You can view the
documentation for the examples on the Qt website, and compare them with the
exmaple code to get a feel for the bindings.  The project aims to have all
examples fully functional.
Note: if you get errors about 'Couldn't find blib even in ...', run the
following on the example files:
sed -i 's/^use blib;$/d' *
