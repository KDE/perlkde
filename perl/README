PerlQt version 0.01
===================

This module provides bindings to the Qt 4 libraries for Perl.

PREREQUISITES

The bindings depend on the smokeqt library, which is currently maintained in
the kdebindings package from kde.org.  You must build and install it first.
However, you don't need to build the whole package.  The easiest way is to
follow the instructions listed at the top of the CMakeLists.txt.qtruby file in
the top-level directory of the kdebindings package.  If you don't have ruby
installed, there's an option to cmake (I believe it is WITH_RUBY) that you can
set to 'off'.  This will give you what you need to build the bindings.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The Makefile.PL uses pkg-config to find Qt.  If you have Qt installed in a
non-standard location, set your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the
location of Qt's .pc files (e.g. /opt/qt/lib/pkgconfig).
